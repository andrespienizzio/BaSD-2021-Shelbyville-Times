#### RESOLUTION

> **Mobile First**

The concept of mobile first was used, therefore, the html and css file was written taking into account the screen of a cell phone.

> **Media query**

The site was designed starting with a screen of 480 pixels wide, and then scaling the resolution with the use of media queries up to reach resolutions of tablet (768x585px), laptop (1024x780px) and from there until reaching a maximum resolution of 1200 pixels wide.

> **Responsive**

Flexbox was used to get the site to respond as the size of the screen where the content was displayed changed.

#### REPOSITORY 

In the repository you will find the main file, the index.html file, along with a css folder, where the style files, fonts and media queries are. Also, there is a folder called "images" where the images used in the project are located.
